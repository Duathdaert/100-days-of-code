# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Goals 
    - learn to create software with Python,
    - learn to develop machine learning algos with Python,
    - possible final output: UK COVID-19 case tracker? (to be fleshed out...),
    - create ideas for using machine learning at work
        - maintenance prediction for parts on BioAccord?
        - build failure tracker?

        

### Day 1: 24/05/2020

**Today's Progress**: Began Python course.

**Thoughts**: Confusing, Python is quite different to .NET. I think the lack of brackets may confuse me to begin with. Different syntax for creating methods/functions/classes etc to get familiar with. Overall I am excited - I am looking forwards to getting to grips with Python and learning some machine learning.
