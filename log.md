# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Goals 
    - learn to create software with Python,
    - learn to develop machine learning algos with Python,
    - possible final output: UK COVID-19 case tracker? (to be fleshed out...),
    - create ideas for using machine learning at work
        - maintenance prediction for parts on BioAccord?
        - build failure tracker?

        

### Day 1: 24/05/2020

**Today's Progress**: Began Python course.

**Thoughts**: Confusing, Python is quite different to .NET. I think the lack of brackets may confuse me to begin with. Different syntax for creating methods/functions/classes etc to get familiar with. Overall I am excited - I am looking forwards to getting to grips with Python and learning some machine learning.

### Day 2: 25/05/2020

**Today's Progress**: Extended Formal Argument syntax and positive lower limit args 
    func(arg1, *args). Created and used a module in the Python console.

**Thoughts**: Python console is cool. The ability to create functions on the fly to try an idea is powerful. I also liked using the '*' syntax preceeding an argument as a way to allow numerous named arguments of the same type.

### Day 3: 26/05/2020

**Today's Progress**: Extended Call syntax and and positional only arguments 

**Thoughts**: Extended calls once I waded through the weird nature of the built in int() function are fine. Simply passing arguments from one function to another. Positional only arguments - arguments that can only be passed positionally. Weird, not sure why it matters, but another feature of Python I guess.

### Day 4: 27/05/2020
**Today's Progress**: First class functions, local functions, name resolution

**Thoughts**: All sensible stuff, local functions are really neat. Can replace private functions for only one thing as in C#. Assigning a function to a local variable (first class functions)
